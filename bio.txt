I have a background in marketing management. Currently, I am a software development student in the Year Up program. My goal is to get my programming certificate and integrate my marketing management expertise with computer programming. The marketing profession needs IT professionals who know the marketing field to create a system that works best with the field. My dream is to be that bridge that connects the two. 
My favorite saying of all times is:
 “When you have a dream, you’ve got to grab it and never let go.”
                                  -Carol Burnett
I live by that motivation because every time I feel like quitting, I remember I have a dream and I can’t let it go and if I do that’s when I know I gave up in life.
